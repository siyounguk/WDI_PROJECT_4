Jac - is from Italy and is visting London for the weekend with his friends. They want to spend one day walking the streets of London doing some sightseeing whilst also stop off at some English Pubs for drinks. They want to get some recommendations from people with local knowledge and/or other tourists who have done a similar thing. They want to make sure that it is a decent tour as they only have two days in the city and want to make sure that they get the most out of their time here.
Jac doesn't know the city at all so will need to use his phone to guide him and his friends on the 'tour'.

Mike - is from London, on Sundays he and his boyfriend like to go for leisurely walks in the city and stop off at a few pubs on the way. They have some of their 'favourite' routes which they could recommend to other people interested in a similar thing. They would also like to find new routes to go on as they have got slightly bored of their existing routes.
